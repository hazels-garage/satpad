# SatPad (formerly CUPCAKE)

30% ortholinear keyboard built using ergogen. 

![Prototype](images/prototype.png)

# WIP

current build has not been fabricated yet, but previous prototype was functional enough that I'm pretty sure this one will work.

## features

- 30 key ortholinear split (10 column, 3 row)
- scroll wheel encoder with click
- oled display

## firmware
QMK: https://github.com/jasonhazel/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/jasonhazel/SatPad

Might fuck around and do a wireless/ZMK version later.
